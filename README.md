## Folder structure

- Templates/ - contains reusable note templates
- Notes/ - general notes and study material

- Readings/ - reading notes and literature summaries
- Projects/ - project and assignment notes
- Daily/ - daily notes and journals
- Assets/ - images and other files

## Templates provided

- lecture-note.md - template for lecture notes
- reading-note.md - template for reading summaries (papers, chapters)
- project-template.md - template to plan and track projects

(If you want, I can add example templates as separate files.)

## Example workflow

1. For each lecture, create a new note from `Templates/lecture-note.md` and save it under `Lectures/<CourseName>/`.
2. For readings, use `Templates/reading-note.md`, include bibliographic metadata, and link to related lecture notes.
3. Regularly review and link notes together. Use tags like `#course/<name>` and `#project/<name>`.
4. Use Daily notes for quick tasks and to-dos; move longer thoughts into permanent notes.
