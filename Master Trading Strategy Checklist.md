Master Trading Strategy Checklist (Summary)
1. Risk Management (The Downside)
 * Maximum Drawdown (MDD): The biggest account drop from peak to trough.
 * Risk-Reward Ratio: The amount of capital risked vs. potential profit per trade.
 * Risk of Ruin: The statistical probability of wiping out the entire account.
2. Profitability Metrics (The Upside)
 * Expectancy: The mathematical average profit or loss per trade over time.
 * Profit Factor: Gross profits divided by gross losses (must be > 1.0 to survive).
 * Risk-Adjusted Returns: The amount of risk taken to achieve the profit (measured by Sharpe/Sortino ratios).
3. Backtest vs. Reality (Market Mechanics)
 * Overfitting: Tweaking parameters so perfectly to past data that the system breaks in future live markets.
 * Slippage & Liquidity: Whether you can actually secure your intended entry/exit prices in live market conditions.
 * Transaction Costs: Factoring in broker fees, spreads, and taxes that eat into the profit margin.
4. Execution & Feasibility (Operations)
 * Time Commitment: The amount of screen time required versus the actual yield.
 * Opportunity Cost: Whether the active trading effort beats passive, zero-effort investments.
 * Market Adaptability: Whether the strategy survives choppy, sideways markets, or only works during massive trends.
