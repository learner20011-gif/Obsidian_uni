​The PACER Categories & Processes
​To remember what you read, you must identify which of the five categories the information belongs to and apply the specific "digestion" process.

|Category|Definition|Targeted Process|Key Takeaway|
|---|---|---|---|
|Procedural|"How-to" info (coding, clinical skills)|Practice|Apply in real-life as early as possible [06:36].|
|Analogous|Related to existing prior knowledge|Critique|Evaluate how well the analogy fits and where it breaks [11:32].|
|Conceptual|The "What" and "Why" (theories, facts)|Mapping|Use nonlinear Mind Maps to recreate the expert's network [16:10].|
|Evidence|Detailed facts/stats that prove concepts|Store & Rehearse|Note it down immediately; use it in problem-solving later [20:20].|
|Reference|Nitty-gritty details (constants, names)|Flashcards|
