"Text Classification Modeling Approach on Imbalanced-Unstructured Traffic Accident Descriptions Data","The BERT-based model effectively extracts meaningful information from traffic crash descriptions, aiding in understanding unique crash characteristics and developing countermeasures to prevent future crashes.","Y. Seo, Ji-hyeok Park, Gyungtaek Oh, Hyungjoo Kim, Jia Hu, J. So",2023,6,"The unstructured-textual crash descriptions recorded by police officers is rarely utilized, despite containing detailed information on traffic situations. This lack of utilization is mainly due to the difficulty in analyzing text data, as there is currently no innovative methodology for extracting meaningful information from it. Given limitations and challenges in analyzing traffic crash descriptions, this study developed a methodology to classify significant words in unstructured data that describe traffic crash scenarios into standardized data. Ultimately, a natural language processing technique, specifically a bidirectional encoder representation from transformer (BERT), was used to extract meaningful information from crash descriptions. This BERT-based model effectively extracts information on the exact collision point and the pre-crash vehicle maneuver from crash descriptions. Its practical approach allows for the interpretation of traffic crash descriptions and outperforms other natural language processing models. Importantly, this method of extracting crash scene information from traffic crash descriptions can aid in better comprehending the unique characteristics of traffic crashes. This comprehension can ultimately aid in the development of appropriate countermeasures, leading to the prevention of future traffic crashes.","","IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems","1","10.1109/ojits.2023.3335817","https://consensus.app/papers/text-classification-modeling-approach-on-seo-park/08db4b6100f75ecdafd7ba3dca3ec18a/"
"Road Safety in Low-Income Countries: State of Knowledge and Future Directions","Improving data systems, understanding non-fatal injuries, and capacity development are crucial for improving road safety in low-income countries.","S. Heydari, A. Hickford, Rich C. McIlroy, J. Turner, A. Bachani",2019,141,"Road safety in low-income countries (LICs) remains a major concern. Given the expected increase in traffic exposure due to the relatively rapid motorisation of transport in LICs, it is imperative to better understand the underlying mechanisms of road safety. This in turn will allow for planning cost-effective road safety improvement programs in a timely manner. With the general aim of improving road safety in LICs, this paper discusses the state of knowledge and proposes a number of future research directions developed from literature reviews and expert elicitation. Our study takes a holistic approach based on the Safe Systems framework and the framework for the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety. We focused mostly on examining the problem from traffic engineering and safety policy standpoints, but also touched upon other sectors, including public health and social sciences. We identified ten focus areas relating to (i) under-reporting; (ii) global best practices; (iii) vulnerable groups; (iv) disabilities; (v) road crash costing; (vi) vehicle safety; (vii) proactive approaches; (viii) data challenges; (ix) social/behavioural aspects; and (x) capacity building. Based on our findings, future research ought to focus on improvement of data systems, understanding the impact of and addressing non-fatal injuries, improving estimates on the economic burden, implementation research to scale up programs and transfer learnings, as well as capacity development. Our recommendations, which relate to both empirical and methodological frontiers, would lead to noteworthy improvements in the way road safety data collection and research is conducted in the context of LICs.","literature review","Sustainability","1","10.3390/su11226249","https://consensus.app/papers/road-safety-in-lowincome-countries-state-of-knowledge-and-heydari-hickford/bef254ba6aef5f46aa406ed316f58564/"
"Road Traffic Injury Prevention Initiatives: A Systematic Review and Metasummary of Effectiveness in Low and Middle Income Countries","Legislation combined with strong enforcement initiatives is the most effective road traffic injury prevention strategy in low and middle-income countries.","C. Staton, J. Vissoci, Enying Gong, Nicole Toomey, Rebecca B Wafula, Jihad Abdelgadir, Yi Zhou, Chen Liu, Fengdi Pei, Brittany Zick, Camille D. Ratliff, Claire Rotich, Nicole Jadue, Luciano de Andrade, Megan von Isenburg, M. Hocker",2016,229,"Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a growing but neglected global health crisis, requiring effective prevention to promote sustainable safety. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) share a disproportionately high burden with 90% of the world's road traffic deaths, and where RTIs are escalating due to rapid urbanization and motorization. Although several studies have assessed the effectiveness of a specific intervention, no systematic reviews have been conducted summarizing the effectiveness of RTI prevention initiatives specifically performed in LMIC settings; this study will help fill this gap. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines we searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, TRID, Lilacs, Scielo and Global Health. Articles were eligible if they considered RTI prevention in LMICs by evaluating a prevention-related intervention with outcome measures of crash, RTI, or death. In addition, a reference and citation analysis was conducted as well as a data quality assessment. A qualitative metasummary approach was used for data analysis and effect sizes were calculated to quantify the magnitude of emerging themes. Of the 8560 articles from the literature search, 18 articles from 11 LMICs fit the eligibility and inclusion criteria. Of these studies, four were from Sub-Saharan Africa, ten from Latin America and the Caribbean, one from the Middle East, and three from Asia. Half of the studies focused specifically on legislation, while the others focused on speed control measures, educational interventions, enforcement, road improvement, community programs, or a multifaceted intervention. Legislation was the most common intervention evaluated with the best outcomes when combined with strong enforcement initiatives or as part of a multifaceted approach. Because speed control is crucial to crash and injury prevention, road improvement interventions in LMIC settings should carefully consider how the impact of improvements will affect speed and traffic flow. Further road traffic injury prevention interventions should be performed in LMICs with patient-centered outcomes in order to guide injury prevention in these complex settings.","systematic review","PLoS ONE","1","10.1371/journal.pone.0144971","https://consensus.app/papers/road-traffic-injury-prevention-initiatives-a-systematic-staton-vissoci/d6d9007de1895529ab8eef22df0784e4/"
"Red light camera interventions for reducing traffic violations and traffic crashes: A systematic review","Red light cameras may effectively reduce red light violations and some traffic crashes, but may also increase rear end crashes.","E. Cohn, S. Kakar, C. Perkins, Rebecca Steinbach, Phil Edwards",2020,30,"Road traffic crashes are a major and increasing cause of injury and death around the world. In 2015, there were almost 6.3 million motor vehicle traffic crashes in the United States. Of these, approximately 1.7 million (27%) involved some form of injury and 32,166 (0.5%) resulted in one or more fatalities (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2016, Traffic Safety Facts 2013: A Compilation of Motor Vehicle Crash Data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and the General Estimates System). The most common cause of urban crashes appears to be drivers running red lights or ignoring other traffic controls and injuries occur in 39% of all of these types of crashes (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, IIHS, 2018, Red light running). While many drivers obey traffic signals, the possibility for violations exists due to issues such as driver distraction, aggressive driving behaviors, or a deliberate decision to ignore the traffic signal. One researcher suggests that eliminating traffic violations could reduce road injury crashes by up to 40% (Zaal, 1994,). Red light cameras (RLCs) are an enforcement mechanism that permit police to remotely enforce traffic signals; they may serve as a deterrent to drivers who intentionally engage in red light running (RLR). The one previous systematic review of RLCs found that they were effective in reducing total casualty crashes but also found that evidence on the effectiveness of cameras on red light violations, total crashes, or specific types of casualty crashes was inconclusive. However, this review searched only a small number of electronic databases and was limited to a handful of studies published in 2002 or earlier. This report updates and expands upon the previous Cochrane systematic review of RLCs. The aim of this review is to systematically review and synthesize the available evidence on the effectiveness of RLCs on the incidence of red light violations and the incidence and severity of various types of traffic crashes. This study uses a four-part search strategy that involves: (a) searching 27 online electronic bibliographic databases for published and unpublished evaluations of RLCs; (b) searching the websites of 46 international institutes and research agencies focusing on transportation issues for reports and other gray literature; (c) searching the reference lists of published studies to identify additional published and unpublished works; and (d) conducting a keyword search using Google and Google Scholar to search for additional gray literature. The criteria for inclusion were determined before the search process began. To be eligible, studies must have assessed the impact of RLCs on red light violations and/or traffic crashes. Studies must have employed a quantitative research design that involved randomized controlled trials, quasi-random controlled trials, a controlled before-after design, or a controlled interrupted time series. Research that incorporated additional interventions, such as speed cameras or enhanced police enforcement, were excluded, although normal routine traffic enforcement in the nonintervention control condition was not excluded. Both published and unpublished reports were included. Studies were eligible regardless of the country in which they were conducted or the date of publication. Qualitative, observational, or descriptive studies that did not include formal comparisons of treatment and control groups were excluded from this research. Initial searches produced a total of 5,708 references after duplicates were removed. After title and abstract screening, a total of 121 references remained. Full-text review of these works identified 28 primary studies meeting the inclusion criteria, in addition to the 10 studies identified in the prior Cochrane review. Because several of the primary studies reported on multiple independent study areas, this report evaluates 41 separate analyses. At least two review authors independently assessed all records for eligibility, assessed methodological risk of bias, and extracted data from the full-text reports; disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third review author. To facilitate comparisons between studies, a standardized summary measure based on relative effects, rather than differences in effects, was defined for each outcome. Summary measures were calculated for all studies when possible. When at least three studies reported the same outcome, the results were pooled in a meta-analysis. Pooled meta-analyses were carried out when at least three studies reported the same outcome; otherwise, the results of individual studies were described in a narrative. Heterogeneity among effect estimates was assessed usingtests at a 5% level of significance and quantified using thestatistic. EMMIE framework data were coded using the EPPIE Reviewer database. The results of this systematic review suggest that RLCs are associated with a statistically significant reduction in crash outcomes, although this varies by type of crash, and suggest a reduction in red light violations. RLCs are associated with a a 20% decrease in total injury crashes, a 24% decrease in right angle crashes and a 29% decrease in right angle injury crashes. Conversely, however, RLCs are also associated with a statistically significant increase in rear end crashes of 19%. There was also some evidence that RLCs were associated with a large reduction in crashes due to red light violations. There is no evidence to suggest that study heterogeneity is consistently explained by either country or risk of bias, nor did the presence or absence of warning signs appear to impact the effectiveness of RLCs. Studies accounting for regression to the mean tend to report more moderate decreases for right angle crashes resulting in injury than studies not accounting for regression to the mean. Studies with better control for confounders reported a nonsignificant decrease in right angle crashes, compared with a significant decrease for all studies. The evidence suggests that RLCs may be effective in reducing red light violations and are likely to be effective in reducing some types of traffic crashes, although they also appear linked to an increase in rear end crashes. Several implications for policymakers and practitioners have emerged from this research. The costs and benefits of RLCs must be considered when implementing RLC programs. The potential benefits of a reduction in traffic violations and in some types of injury crashes must be weighed against the increased risk of other crash types. The economic implications of operating an RLC program also must be considered, including the costs of installation and operation as well as the economic impact of RLC effects.","systematic review","Campbell Systematic Reviews","1","10.1002/cl2.1091","https://consensus.app/papers/red-light-camera-interventions-for-reducing-traffic-cohn-kakar/9cbf95b929675d19975807a2e857b978/"

"ChatGPT Is on the Horizon: Could a Large Language Model Be All We Need for Intelligent Transportation?","ChatGPT, a large language model, has the potential to revolutionize intelligent transportation systems by combining NLP and cross-modal processing, resulting in more efficient, intelligent, and sustainable solutions.","Ou Zheng, M. Abdel-Aty, Dongdong Wang, Zijin Wang, Shengxuan Ding",2023,53,"ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is one of the largest Large Language Models (LLM) with over 175 billion parameters. ChatGPT has demonstrated the impressive capabilities of LLM, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). With the emergence of the discussion and application of LLM in various research or engineering domains, it is time to envision how LLM may revolutionize the way we approach intelligent transportation systems. This paper explores the future applications of LLM in addressing key transportation problems. By leveraging LLM and a cross-modal encoder, an intelligent system can handle traffic data from various modalities and execute transportation operations through a single LLM. NLP, combined with cross-modal processing, is investigated with its potential applications in transportation. To demonstrate this potential, a smartphone-based crash report auto-generation and analysis framework is presented as a use case. Despite the potential benefits, challenges related to data privacy, data quality, and model bias must be considered. Overall, the use of LLM in intelligent transport systems holds promise for more efficient, intelligent, and sustainable transportation systems that improve the lives of people around the world.","","ArXiv","","10.48550/arxiv.2303.05382","https://consensus.app/papers/chatgpt-is-on-the-horizon-could-a-large-language-model-be-all-zheng-abdel-aty/80ec4f1e68955e2c8985bec42119090f/"
"Predicting the Type of Road Traffic Accident for Test Scenario Generation","The CatBoost model can predict common road traffic accident types, but not rare ones like left-turns with oncoming traffic.","Maximilian Bäumler, Günther Prokop",2024,6,"Automated driving systems should be able to avoid road traffic accidents and drive more safely than human drivers do. Test scenarios derived from real-world data such as police accident data can help assess the safety performance of automated driving systems. In many countries, the police collect data and information about nearly every accident, resulting in a representative sample. However, the collected accident data often do not contain the exact conflicts that cause an accident. Therefore, we estimated the globally known three-digit accident type for German police accident data, describing accident-causing conflicts. The data supplemented by the estimated three-digit accident type can then be used in subsequent test scenario generation. Accordingly, this study presents the first classification model for predicting 30 types of turning accidents. We tested a CatBoost model and a large-language model called BERT, using different feature sets and model designs. Overall, the CatBoost model performed best when using accident descriptions and non-text features such as collision type. Anomaly detection performed before model training revealed additional knowledge-driven miscoding in the police data collection. In conclusion, the model can predict common accident types, such as left-turns with an oncoming straight-ahead driver. In contrast, the model fails to predict rare accident types, such as left-turns (with a lit arrow sign) with oncoming traffic. Future studies should focus on optimizing the developed model, handling data imbalances, and building models using police accident data from other countries.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/access.2024.3367744","https://consensus.app/papers/predicting-the-type-of-road-traffic-accident-for-test-b%C3%A4umler-prokop/2fdc8e3daa575b49b4d3290782c1ba9a/"
"Qualitative methods of road traffic crash research in low- and middle-income countries: a review","Qualitative methods can enhance road traffic crash research in low- and middle-income countries by examining contexts and social processes, enhancing crash prevention interventions and involving affected community members.","Benjamin D. Holmes, Kristin Haglund, Kristin M M Beyer, L. Cassidy",2018,11,"Road traffic crashes are rapidly becoming one of the leading causes of injury and death globally. It is predicted that by 2030 crashes will become the fourth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (Mathers & Loncar, 2006) and the seventh leading global cause of death (World Health Organization [WHO], 2016). The global death toll due to crashes has already escalated by 46% over the past two decades (The World Bank, 2014). Lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) are acutely affected by this ‘hidden epidemic’ (Balch, 2013). Ninety per cent of the world’s crash-related deaths occur in LMICs where only 54% of its motor vehicles are registered (WHO, 2015). Furthermore, the economic toll of crashes in LMICs is concerning because nearly one half of all health care expenditures in LMICs is used to treat injuries related to motor vehicle crashes (Zakeri & Nosratnejad, 2017). This epidemic deserves urgent attention (Lin, 2016). Research on the epidemiology of crash problems in LMICs is increasing but these research efforts predominantly report statistics. There is a paucity of qualitative research that could help to explain the statistics. Qualitative exploration has the potential to enhance crash research by describing and explicating the contexts and social processes surrounding crashes, such as the antecedents, the environments in which crashes occur and injuries are produced, and the behaviours of people which make crashes more likely (Roberts, 1997; Rothe, 2000). Qualitative research methods can spark and mobilize the ideas and efforts of affected community members, thereby optimizing crash prevention interventions. Additionally, incorporating local citizens’ perspectives on the nature, causes and potential solutions of traffic problems in their locale increases the likelihood that proposed solutions will be effective, wanted and beneficial (Roberts, Smith, & Bryce, 1995). This article will review the literature to assess the extent to which qualitative methods have been implemented to research road traffic crashes in LMICs and to inform future methodological decision-making.

"Investigating Injury Outcomes of Horse-and-Buggy Crashes in Rural Michigan by Mining Crash Reports Using NLP and CNN Algorithms","Horse-and-buggy crashes in rural Michigan are exacerbated by factors such as distracted motorists, nighttime visibility issues, and failure to yield, highlighting the need for comprehensive safety measures.","Baraah Qawasmeh, Jun-Seok Oh, Valerian Kwigizile",2024,2,"Horse-and-buggy transportation, vital for many rural communities and the Amish population, has been largely overlooked in safety research. This study examines the characteristics and injury severity of horse-and-buggy roadway crashes in Michigan’s rural areas. Detailed crash data are essential for safety studies, as crash scene descriptions are mainly found in narratives and diagrams. However, extracting and utilizing this information from traffic reports is challenging. This research tackles these challenges using image-processing and text-mining techniques to analyze crash diagrams and narratives. The study employs the AlexNet convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify and extract horse-and-buggy crashes, analyzing (2020–2023) Michigan UD-10 rural crash reports. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques also identified primary risk factors from crash narratives, analyzing single-word patterns (“unigrams”) and sequences of three consecutive words (“trigrams”). The findings emphasize the risks involved in horse-and-buggy interactions on rural roadways and highlight various contributing factors to the severity of these crashes, including distracted or careless actions by motorists, nighttime visibility issues, and failure to yield, especially by elderly drivers. This study suggests prioritizing horse-and-buggy riders in road safety and public health programs and recommends comprehensive measures that could significantly reduce crash incidence and severity, improving overall safety in Michigan’s rural areas, including better signage, driver education, and community outreach. Also, the study highlights the potential of advanced image-processing techniques in traffic safety research that could lead to more precise and actionable findings, enhancing road safety for all users.","","Safety","2","10.3390/safety11010001","https://consensus.app/papers/investigating-injury-outcomes-of-horseandbuggy-crashes-qawasmeh-oh/1faa203846f9589896e84b03d26190df/"

"Completeness of police reporting of traffic crashes in Nepal: Evaluation using a community crash recording system","Local Record Keepers' recording of road traffic crashes in Nepal provides a more complete record than police data, highlighting the underreporting of minor injuries, property damage, and single-vehicle crashes.","Anish R. Khadka, J. Parkin, P. Pilkington, S. Joshi, J. Mytton",2022,11,"Accurate road crash reporting is essential for evaluating road safety interventions and plans. Under-reporting of road traffic crashes, injuries, and fatalities in police records has been widely described. The aim of this study was to apply and evaluate a community crash recording system, and assess the quality of the data in comparison with traffic police data in Nepal. The crash data collection methodology involved recruiting Local Record Keepers working and living at locations known to be at a high risk of crashes. Six shopkeepers were recruited at three crash locations and trained to complete collision incident forms for crashes occurring over one year on the section of road visible from their premises. Manual traffic volume and pedestrian counts, and spot speed surveys were conducted. Data were compared with District police records for the same period and locations. Over 12 months, 110 crashes were recorded by the Local Record Keepers. Of these, 70 resulted in 145 injuries (5 fatalities, 62 severe, and 78 minor injuries), while 40 resulted only in property damage. Comparable police data recorded 23 crashes, of which 18 crashes resulted in 27 injuries (8 fatalities, 13 serious, and 6 minor injuries), and 5 crashes in property damage only. The difference in recording of fatal and serious injuries was statistically significant (χ(1) = 19.94, p < 0.001). The police reporting rate was highest for fatalities (62.5%) but only 11.6% and 7.1% for property damage cases and minor injuries respectively, and 3.8% for single-vehicle crashes. Compared to the Local Record Keeper data, the overall police crash reporting rate was 19.7%. Local Record Keepers' recording of road traffic crashes and casualties is feasible and provides a more complete record than routinely collected police data. The low reporting rate in the police records of minor injury, property damage, and single-vehicle crashes suggest significant underestimation and bias in the reporting of the actual burden of road traffic crashes.

This paper describes a complementary new methodology for road crash data collection called the Local Record Keeper (LRK) methodology. This methodology deploys trained people from the local community and a new supervisory and quality control process to record road crashes. A comprehensive description of the LRK methodology is provided. The LRKs were able to collect most of the data in the crash forms without difficulty. The LRK methodology recorded significantly more crash data than the Police and provided details on crash location and road user involvement that were important input for the design of a speed management programme on a rural highway that traverses three villages in Bangladesh. A 19.7% reduction of the mean speed caused by the speed management programme was accompanied by a recorded reduction in the LRK data of 66.7% in the number of fatalities, and 59.4% in the number of serious injuries. These recorded reductions as a result of measured speed reductions were consistent with what has been reported in the literature.

Findings from pragmatic approaches that explore spatial and temporal trends of past road crashes can inform novel interventions. To improve access to PTCS and reduce burden of road traffic injuries we explored geospatial trends of past emergency responses to road traffic crashes (RTCs) by Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS), assessed efficiency of responses, and outcomes of interventions by local government areas (LGAs) of crash. Using descriptive cross-sectional design and REDcap we explored pre-hospital care data of 1220 crash victims documented on LASAMBUS intervention forms from December 2017 to May 2018. We analyzed trends in days and times of calls, demographics of victims, locations of crashes and causes of delayed emergency responses. Assisted with STATA 16 and ArcGIS pro we conducted descriptive statistics and mapping of crash metrics including spatial and temporal relationships between times of the day, seasons of year, and crash LGA population density versus RTCs incidence. Descriptive analysis and mapping were used to assess relationships between 'Causes of Delayed response' and respective crash LGAs, and between Response Times and crash LGAs. Incidences of RTCs were highest across peak commuting hours (07:00-12:59 and 13:00-18:59), rainy season and harmattan (foggy) months, and densely populated LGAs. Five urban LGAs accounted for over half of RTCs distributions: Eti-Osa (14.7%), Ikeja (14.4%), Kosofe (9.9%), Ikorodu (9.7%), and Alimosho (6.6%). On intervention forms with a Cause of Delay, Traffic Congestion (60%), and Poor Description (17.8%), had associations with LGA distribution. Two densely populated urban LGAs, Agege and Apapa were significantly associated with Traffic Congestion as a Cause of Delay. LASAMBUS was able to address crash in only 502 (36.8%) of the 1220 interventions. Other notable outcomes include: No Crash (false calls) (26.6%), and Crash Already Addressed (22.17%).

"PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization","PEGASUS, a Transformer-based model pre-trained with extracted gap-sentences, achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse text summarization tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art results on low-resource datasets.","Jingqing Zhang, Yao Zhao, Mohammad Saleh, Peter J. Liu",2019,2308,"Recent work pre-training Transformers with self-supervised objectives on large text corpora has shown great success when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks including text summarization. However, pre-training objectives tailored for abstractive text summarization have not been explored. Furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across diverse domains. In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. In PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an input document and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on 12 downstream summarization tasks spanning news, science, stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE scores. Our model also shows surprising performance on low-resource summarization, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on 6 datasets with only 1000 examples. Finally we validated our results using human evaluation and show that our model summaries achieve human performance on multiple datasets.","","ArXiv","","","https://consensus.app/papers/pegasus-pretraining-with-extracted-gapsentences-for-zhang-zhao/aa3d1cfd99c155958e2ac92c120b2ee3/"
"Trend analysis and fatality causes in Kenyan roads: A review of road traffic accident data between 2015 and 2020","Kenyan road traffic accidents have increased by 26% and 46.5% from 2015 to 2020, with preventable driver errors being the leading cause of fatalities.","Joseph K. Muguro, M. Sasaki, Kojiro Matsushita, Waweru Njeri",2020,20,"Abstract With increasing population and motorization, Kenya as well as other African countries are faced with a tragic road traffic accidents (RTA). This paper looks at 5-year (2015–2020) data downloaded from National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) website, to identify trends and review progress of the traffic accidents in the country. The objective is to assess the prevalence of accidents within affected groups and location to identify trends and generalized causative agency from the reported data. From literature review, research activity focused on RTA in the country is minimal compared to the social significance accidents poses. The data were extracted and classified using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a machine learning algorithm modelled in Matlab to group reported accident briefs into general categories/topic which are closely related. Four categories were identified as leading causes of fatality in the country: Knocking down victims, hit-and-run, losing control and head on collision. The identified causes point to preventable driver’s errors which agrees with other researchers. From trend analysis, fatalities and injuries have increased by 26% and 46.5%, respectively since January 2015 to January 2020. This paper found that injuries in vulnerable road users: pedestrians, pillion passengers and motorcyclist, has seen a foldfold increment compared to 2015 data. From the discussion, urgent fine-tuning of policing to protect vulnerable road user as well as curb the overly decried driver behavior is needed. The paper recommends fine-tuning of data collection, capturing details of accident that will be useful in modeling and data analysis for future planning.","literature review","Cogent Engineering","2","10.1080/23311916.2020.1797981","https://consensus.app/papers/trend-analysis-and-fatality-causes-in-kenyan-roads-a-review-muguro-sasaki/2b97a83cb61553779f0ee8792560d5f6/"
"Examining Car Accident Prediction Techniques and Road Traffic Congestion: A Comparative Analysis of Road Safety and Prevention of World Challenges in Low-Income and High-Income Countries","Machine learning and spatial analysis techniques can effectively predict car accidents and reduce traffic congestion, especially in low-income countries with higher fatality rates.","Yetay Berhanu, Esayas Alemayehu, D. Schröder",2023,67,"Road accidents are a significant negative outcome of transportation systems, causing injuries, fatalities, traffic congestion, and economic losses. As cities expand and the number of vehicles on the road increases, traffic accidents (TAs) have become a significant problem. Studies have shown that urban development plays a more significant role in transportation safety than previously thought. Low-income countries have higher fatality rates than high-income countries, according to the Permanent International Association of Road Congress (PIARC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Predicting and preventing the occurrence of accidents and congestion is necessary worldwide, especially in developing countries where fatality rates are higher. The objective of this study is to examine and make a comparative analysis in low-income and high-income countries of the existing literature on the global challenge of car accidents and use its prediction techniques to enhance road safety and reduce traffic congestion. The study evaluates various approaches such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, deep neural network, support vector machine, random forest, K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes, empirical Bayes, geospatial analysis methods, and UIMA, NSGA-II, and MOPS algorithms. The research identifies current challenges, prevention ideas, and future directions for preventing accidents and congestion on the road network. Integrating GIS-based spatial statistical methods and temporal data and utilizing advanced optimization algorithms and machine learning methods can result in accurate prediction models that can help identify accident hotspots and reduce congestions and enhance traffic safety and mitigate their occurrence. Effectively preventing urban traffic congestion requires the integration of spatial data into precise accident prediction models. By employing spatial analysis, road safety planning can be enhanced, high-risk areas can be identified, interventions can be evaluated, and resources can be optimally allocated to facilitate effective road safety measures and decision-making, especially in settings with limited resources. Therefore, it is crucial to consider ML and spatial analysis techniques and advanced optimization algorithms to enhance traffic flow control, in road safety research and transport planning efforts.","","Journal of Advanced Transportation","2","10.1155/2023/6643412","https://consensus.app/papers/examining-car-accident-prediction-techniques-and-road-berhanu-alemayehu/40f8fe83722157dcbc924d40295b5fa1/"
