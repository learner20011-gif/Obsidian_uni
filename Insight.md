My idea is that today, with AI agents handling coding and development, knowing syntax is no longer essential. What really matters is understanding system design, identifying which tools can solve a problem, and knowing the capabilities each tool offers. You don’t need to know how to implement those capabilities in detail, since AI agents can handle that part.

However, you must be aware of what a tool can do so you can instruct the AI effectively. Once you understand a tool’s capabilities, you can plan solutions around it. There’s no need to memorize low-level details. This concept goes beyond coding and development—if you understand what something is capable of, you can quickly recognize how it can solve a problem, and if you don’t know the implementation, you can always search for it or rely on AI.
