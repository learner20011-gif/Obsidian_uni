### 14. Classification: Differentiate/Distinguish between water tube boiler and fire tube boiler.

**Answer:**

| Feature | Fire Tube Boiler | Water Tube Boiler |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Principle** | Flue gas passes through the tube and the heat of flue gas is absorbed by the tube and transferred to water surrounding the tube. | Water flows inside the tube and the tube is kept in the path of flow of flue gas. |
| **Examples** | Cochran boiler, Locomotive boiler, Lancashire boiler, and Cornish boiler. | Babcock and Wilcox Boiler, Benson boiler, Loffler boiler, etc. |
| **Pressure Suitability** | Generally lower pressure. | Most high-pressure boilers are water tube boilers. |

## Specific Boilers

### 15. Vertical Boiler: Explain the construction and working of a simple vertical boiler with suitable sketches.

**Answer:**
*(Note: The lecture specifically details the Cochran Boiler as a vertical boiler type. The general working follows the fire-tube principle described below.)*

A **Vertical Boiler** is a type of fire tube boiler where the shell is vertical.
*   **Construction:** Ideally involves a cylindrical shell with a firebox at the bottom.
*   **Working:** Fuel is burnt on the grate. Hot flue gases rise from the firebox, pass through tubes (heating the water surrounding them), and escape through the chimney.

**Similar Slide References:**
*   **Slide 7:** Mentions Vertical boilers.
*   **Slide 16-17:** Discusses Cochran Boiler.

### 16. Cochran Boiler: Describe the working principle of a Cochran boiler with a neat sketch.

**Answer:**
The **Cochran Boiler** is a fire tube, multi-tube, internal fired, and vertical boiler.

**Working Principle:**
1.  **Combustion:** Fuel is burnt on the grate in the firebox.
2.  **Heat Transfer:** The hot flue gas passes through the fire tubes located in the water space, and heat is transferred to the water. Water becomes hot in contact with the tube surface.
3.  **Exhaust:** Flue gas goes to the smoke box and finally into the atmosphere through the chimney.
4.  **Circulation:** The circulation of water is natural; hot water rises up and cold water comes down.
5.  **Steam Collection:** The steam formed is collected at the upper space of the dome-shaped shell and supplied for use through a steam stop valve.

### 19. Specific Functions: Discuss the function of the flowing items.

**Answer:**
*   **Economizer:** A heat exchanger installed between the furnace exit and chimney entry. It exchanges waste heat from flue gases to the feed water.
    *   *Function:* Increases power output (efficiency increases ~1% for every 60°C rise), evaporation capacity, and boiler life (less thermal stress).
*   **Air Preheater:** A device for the recovery of waste heat from flue gas, placed in the path of waste flue gas going to the chimney.
    *   *Function:* Transfers heat to air before it enters the furnace to support economical combustion. Increases boiler efficiency by 2-10% and allows use of low-grade fuel.
*   **Superheater:** A surface heat exchanger located in the path of flue gas.
    *   *Function:* Superheats the wet steam generated in the boiler to a desired temperature. It increases prime mover efficiency, minimizes condensation loss, eliminates turbine blade erosion, and increases plant capacity.
*   **Safety Valves:** Used to release excess pressure inside the boiler drum.
    *   *Function:* When pressure exceeds the working limit, it blows off steam to the atmosphere to prevent explosions.
*   **Water Level Indicator:** Two indicators are provided on the boiler drum.
    *   *Function:* Indicates the water level inside the boiler (connected to steam and water spaces).
*   **Pressure Gauge:**
    *   *Function:* Shows the pressure of steam in the drum. Uses a tube spring, link, sector gear, and pinion mechanism to move a pointer.
*   **Feed Check Valve:**
    *   *Function:* Allows flow of water from feed pump to boiler and prevents backflow in case of pump failure. It is a one-way valve.
*   **Steam Stop Valve:**
    *   *Function:* Stops or allows the flow of steam from the boiler to the steam pipe or supply.
*   **Blow-off Cock:** Fitted at the lowest portion of the boiler.
    *   *Function:* Used to blow down sediments collected at the bottom, empty the boiler, or lower the water level.
*   **Fusible Plug:**
    *   *Function:* Extinguishes fire in the firebox when water level drops below the limit. The fusible metal melts due to overheating, allowing steam to rush in and put out the fire, preventing damage.
*   **Feed Pump:**
    *   *Function:* To feed water to the boiler. (Types: Reciprocating, Centrifugal, Injector).
*   **Steam Separator:**
    *   *Function:* Separates suspended water particles carried by steam on its way to the engine/turbine.

## Numerical Problems

*(Note: Numerical solution methods are based on the formulas provided in the lectures)*

### Formulas (from Lecture 5):
*   **Evaporation Rate:** Can be expressed as kg of steam per unit heating surface, per cubic meter of furnace volume, or per kg of fuel burnt.
*   **Equivalent Evaporation ($m_e$):** The evaporation of 1 kg of water at 100°C to dry and saturated steam at 100°C (requires 2257 kJ).
    *   Formula: $m_e = \frac{m_a (h - h_f)}{2257}$
    *   Where $m_a$ = Mass of steam produced / Mass of fuel burnt (Evaporation ratio).
*   **Factor of Evaporation ($F_e$):** Ratio of heat absorbed by 1 kg feed water under working conditions to latent heat of steam at atmospheric pressure.
    *   Formula: $F_e = \frac{h - h_f}{2257}$
*   **Boiler Efficiency ($\eta$):** Ratio of heat actually utilized in the generator to the heat supplied by the fuel.
    *   Formula: $\eta = \frac{m_a (h - h_f)}{C}$
    *   Where $C$ = Calorific value of fuel.

### 20. Lancashire Boiler Problem
**Statement:** Generates 2400 kg/hr steam at 11 bar. Coal burnt 90 kg/m²... Determine Actual evaporation, Equivalent evaporation, Efficiency.
*   **Method:**
    1.  **Actual Evaporation ($m_a$):** Calculate total coal burnt $\dot{m}_f$ using grate area. Then $m_a = \dot{m}_s / \dot{m}_f$.
    2.  **Equivalent Evaporation:** Use $m_e = m_a \times F_e = m_a \frac{(h - h_f)}{2257}$.
    3.  **Efficiency:** $\eta = \frac{m_a (h - h_f)}{C}$.

### 21. Boiler Trial (400kg coal)
**Statement:** Coal consumed 400 kg/hr. Steam 3200 kg. Find Equivalent evaporation and Thermal efficiency.
*   **Method:**
    1.  Given $\dot{m}_f = 400$ kg/hr, $\dot{m}_s = 3200$ kg/hr.
    2.  $m_a = 3200 / 400 = 8$ kg steam/kg coal.
    3.  Calculate $F_e = \frac{h - h_f}{2257}$.
    4.  **Equivalent Evaporation:** $m_e = m_a \times F_e$.
    5.  **Efficiency:** $\eta = \frac{m_a (h - h_f)}{C}$.

*   **Method:**
    1.  **Boiler Efficiency:** $\eta_{boiler} = \frac{\text{Heat gained by water in boiler}}{\text{Heat supplied}}$.
        *   Heat gained = $\dot{m}_s (h_{steam} - h_{feed\_after\_economizer})$.
    2.  **Plant Efficiency:** $\eta_{plant} = \frac{\text{Heat gained by water in plant}}{\text{Heat supplied}}$.
        *   Heat gained = $\dot{m}_s (h_{steam} - h_{feed\_inlet\_to\_economizer})$.

### 25. Coal Consumption
**Statement:** Steam used by turbine is 5.4 kg/kWh... Boiler efficiency 80%... How many kg of coal required?
*   **Method:**
    1.  Calculate Heat Output required = $\text{Steam Rate} \times (h - h_f)$.
    2.  Calculate Heat Input required = $\frac{\text{Heat Output}}{\eta}$.
    3.  Coal Consumption = $\frac{\text{Heat Input}}{C}$.
