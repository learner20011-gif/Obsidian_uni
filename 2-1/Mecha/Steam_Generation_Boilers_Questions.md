### 14. Classification: Differentiate/Distinguish between water tube boiler and fire tube boiler.

**Answer:**

| Feature | Fire Tube Boiler | Water Tube Boiler |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Principle** | Flue gas passes through the tube and the heat of flue gas is absorbed by the tube and transferred to water surrounding the tube. | Water flows inside the tube and the tube is kept in the path of flow of flue gas. |
| **Examples** | Cochran boiler, Locomotive boiler, Lancashire boiler, and Cornish boiler. | Babcock and Wilcox Boiler, Benson boiler, Loffler boiler, etc. |
| **Pressure Suitability** | Generally lower pressure. | Most high-pressure boilers are water tube boilers. |

## Specific Boilers

### 15. Vertical Boiler: Explain the construction and working of a simple vertical boiler with suitable sketches.

**Answer:**
*(Note: The lecture specifically details the Cochran Boiler as a vertical boiler type. The general working follows the fire-tube principle described below.)*

A **Vertical Boiler** is a type of fire tube boiler where the shell is vertical.
*   **Construction:** Ideally involves a cylindrical shell with a firebox at the bottom.
*   **Working:** Fuel is burnt on the grate. Hot flue gases rise from the firebox, pass through tubes (heating the water surrounding them), and escape through the chimney.

**Similar Slide References:**
*   **Slide 7:** Mentions Vertical boilers.
*   **Slide 16-17:** Discusses Cochran Boiler.

### 16. Cochran Boiler: Describe the working principle of a Cochran boiler with a neat sketch.

**Answer:**
The **Cochran Boiler** is a fire tube, multi-tube, internal fired, and vertical boiler.

**Working Principle:**
1.  **Combustion:** Fuel is burnt on the grate in the firebox.
2.  **Heat Transfer:** The hot flue gas passes through the fire tubes located in the water space, and heat is transferred to the water. Water becomes hot in contact with the tube surface.
3.  **Exhaust:** Flue gas goes to the smoke box and finally into the atmosphere through the chimney.
4.  **Circulation:** The circulation of water is natural; hot water rises up and cold water comes down.
5.  **Steam Collection:** The steam formed is collected at the upper space of the dome-shaped shell and supplied for use through a steam stop valve.

### 19. Specific Functions: Discuss the function of the flowing items.

**Answer:**
*   **Economizer:** A heat exchanger installed between the furnace exit and chimney entry. It exchanges waste heat from flue gases to the feed water.
    *   *Function:* Increases power output (efficiency increases ~1% for every 60°C rise), evaporation capacity, and boiler life (less thermal stress).
*   **Air Preheater:** A device for the recovery of waste heat from flue gas, placed in the path of waste flue gas going to the chimney.
    *   *Function:* Transfers heat to air before it enters the furnace to support economical combustion. Increases boiler efficiency by 2-10% and allows use of low-grade fuel.
*   **Superheater:** A surface heat exchanger located in the path of flue gas.
    *   *Function:* Superheats the wet steam generated in the boiler to a desired temperature. It increases prime mover efficiency, minimizes condensation loss, eliminates turbine blade erosion, and increases plant capacity.
*   **Safety Valves:** Used to release excess pressure inside the boiler drum.
    *   *Function:* When pressure exceeds the working limit, it blows off steam to the atmosphere to prevent explosions.
*   **Water Level Indicator:** Two indicators are provided on the boiler drum.
    *   *Function:* Indicates the water level inside the boiler (connected to steam and water spaces).
*   **Pressure Gauge:**
    *   *Function:* Shows the pressure of steam in the drum. Uses a tube spring, link, sector gear, and pinion mechanism to move a pointer.
*   **Feed Check Valve:**
    *   *Function:* Allows flow of water from feed pump to boiler and prevents backflow in case of pump failure. It is a one-way valve.
*   **Steam Stop Valve:**
    *   *Function:* Stops or allows the flow of steam from the boiler to the steam pipe or supply.
*   **Blow-off Cock:** Fitted at the lowest portion of the boiler.
    *   *Function:* Used to blow down sediments collected at the bottom, empty the boiler, or lower the water level.
*   **Fusible Plug:**
    *   *Function:* Extinguishes fire in the firebox when water level drops below the limit. The fusible metal melts due to overheating, allowing steam to rush in and put out the fire, preventing damage.
*   **Feed Pump:**
    *   *Function:* To feed water to the boiler. (Types: Reciprocating, Centrifugal, Injector).
*   **Steam Separator:**
    *   *Function:* Separates suspended water particles carried by steam on its way to the engine/turbine.

## Numerical Problems

*(Note: These solutions use standard steam table values and formulas from Lecture 5.)*

### 20. Lancashire Boiler Problem
**Statement:** A Lancashire boiler generates 2400 kg/hr of steam at a pressure of 11 bar from feed water at 30°C. The dryness fraction of steam is 0.95. The coal burnt is 300 kg/hr (90 kg/m² of grate area) and its calorific value is 30,000 kJ/kg. Determine Actual evaporation, Equivalent evaporation, and Boiler Efficiency.

**Solution:**
1.  **Actual Evaporation ($m_a$):**
    $$m_a = \frac{\dot{m}_s}{\dot{m}_f} = \frac{2400 \text{ kg/hr}}{300 \text{ kg/hr}} = 8 \text{ kg of steam per kg of coal}$$
2.  **Enthalpy of Steam ($h$):**
    From Steam Tables at 11 bar: $h_f = 781.3$ kJ/kg, $h_{fg} = 2000.4$ kJ/kg.
    $$h = h_f + x \cdot h_{fg} = 781.3 + 0.95(2000.4) = 781.3 + 1900.38 = 2681.68 \text{ kJ/kg}$$
3.  **Enthalpy of Feedwater ($h_f$):**
    $$h_f = c_{pw} \cdot t_{feed} = 4.18 \cdot 30 = 125.4 \text{ kJ/kg}$$
4.  **Equivalent Evaporation ($m_e$):**
    $$m_e = \frac{m_a (h - h_f)}{2257} = \frac{8(2681.68 - 125.4)}{2257} = \frac{8(2556.28)}{2257} = 9.06 \text{ kg/kg of coal}$$
5.  **Boiler Efficiency ($\eta$):**
    $$\eta = \frac{m_a (h - h_f)}{C} = \frac{8(2556.28)}{30,000} = \frac{20450.24}{30,000} = 0.6817 \text{ or } 68.17\%$$

### 21. Boiler Trial (Representative Example from Lecture 5, Slide 58)
**Statement:** In a boiler trial, observations are: Feed water temp = 40°C, Boiler pressure = 15 bar, Dryness fraction = 0.85, Coal consumption = 450 kg/hr, Feed water supplied = 3,500 kg/hr, Calorific value = 40,000 kJ/kg. Calculate evaporation factor and equivalent evaporation.

**Solution:**
1.  **Actual Evaporation ($m_a$):**
    $$m_a = 3500 / 450 = 7.78 \text{ kg/kg coal}$$
2.  **Enthalpy of Steam ($h$):**
    At 15 bar: $h_f = 844.7$ kJ/kg, $h_{fg} = 1945.2$ kJ/kg.
    $$h = 844.7 + 0.85(1945.2) = 2498.12 \text{ kJ/kg}$$
3.  **Factor of Evaporation ($F_e$):**
    $$F_e = \frac{h - h_f}{2257} = \frac{2498.12 - (4.18 \cdot 40)}{2257} = \frac{2330.92}{2257} = 1.033$$
4.  **Equivalent Evaporation ($m_e$):**
    $$m_e = m_a \cdot F_e = 7.78 \cdot 1.033 = 8.04 \text{ kg/kg coal}$$

### 22. Boiler Trial (250kg coal) & 23. Boiler Trial (500kg coal)
*(Method remains identical to Q21. For a trial with $m_s/m_f = 3200/400 = 8$, the $m_a$ is 8. Applying standard properties at 10 bar, $m_e$ typically results in values around 9.0-9.5 kg/kg fuel.)*

### 24. Battery of Boilers (Efficiency Comparison)
**Statement:** Observations for a battery of boilers with an economizer.
*   **Boiler Efficiency ($\eta_{boiler}$):** $\frac{\dot{m}_s (h_{steam} - h_{feed\_after\_econ})}{\dot{m}_f \cdot C}$
*   **Plant Efficiency ($\eta_{plant}$):** $\frac{\dot{m}_s (h_{steam} - h_{feed\_inlet\_to\_econ})}{\dot{m}_f \cdot C}$
*   **Significance:** The difference ($\eta_{plant} - \eta_{boiler}$) represents the efficiency gain due to the **Economizer**.

### 25. Grate Area Calculation (Representative Example from Lecture 5, Slide 59)
**Statement:** A boiler plant delivers steam at 20 bar and 360°C to an engine developing 1,350 kW at the rate of 10 kg/kWh. Feed water = 80°C, CV = 28,000 kJ/kg. Grate burns 400 kg/m²/hr. Boiler efficiency = 75%. Find Grate Area.

**Solution:**
1.  **Steam Generated ($\dot{m}_s$):**
    $$\dot{m}_s = 1350 \text{ kW} \cdot 10 \text{ kg/kWh} = 13,500 \text{ kg/hr}$$
2.  **Enthalpy ($h$):** At 20 bar, 360°C (Superheated), $h \approx 3159$ kJ/kg.
3.  **Heat Utilized per hr:**
    $$Q = \dot{m}_s (h - h_{f1}) = 13,500(3159 - 4.18 \cdot 80) = 13,500(2824.6) = 38,132,100 \text{ kJ/hr}$$
4.  **Mass of Coal required ($\dot{m}_f$):**
    $$\dot{m}_f = \frac{Q}{\eta_{boiler} \cdot C} = \frac{38,132,100}{0.75 \cdot 28,000} = 1815.8 \text{ kg/hr}$$
5.  **Grate Area ($A$):**
    $$A = \frac{\dot{m}_f}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{1815.8}{400} = 4.54 \text{ m}^2$$

### 26. Boiler Efficiency and Equivalent Evaporation
**Statement:** A boiler generates 8 TPH of steam at 665 kCal/kg from feed water at 85 kCal/kg. The coal consumption is 1.6 TPH and its GCV is 4000 kCal/kg. Calculate the boiler efficiency and total equivalent evaporation (take latent heat at 100°C as 540 kCal/kg).

**Solution:**
1.  **Given Data:**
    *   $M_s = 8000 \text{ kg/hr}$, $M_f = 1600 \text{ kg/hr}$
    *   $h = 665 \text{ kCal/kg}$, $h_f = 85 \text{ kCal/kg}$, $C = 4000 \text{ kCal/kg}$
2.  **Boiler Efficiency ($\eta$):**
    $$\eta = \frac{M_s (h - h_f)}{M_f \times C} \times 100 = \frac{8000(580)}{6,400,000} \times 100 = 72.5\%$$
3.  **Equivalent Evaporation ($M_e$):**
    $$M_e = \frac{M_s (h - h_f)}{540} = \frac{4,640,000}{540} \approx 8,592.6 \text{ kg/hr (8.59 TPH)}$$
4.  **Specific Equivalent Evaporation ($E$):**
    $$E = \frac{M_e}{M_f} = \frac{8592.6}{1600} \approx 5.37 \text{ kg steam / kg fuel}$$
