# Steam and Steam Generators (Boilers)

**Instructor:** Md. Rasel Ahmed, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, RUET.

## 1. Introduction to Steam
- **Steam:** Gaseous form of water with extensive industrial applications.
- **Applications:** Power generation (Nuclear/Thermal plants) to run turbines.

## 2. Steam Generators (Boilers)
> [!info] Definition
> A combination of apparatus for producing, furnishing, or recovering heat together with apparatus for transferring the heat to water, which is heated and vaporized to steam.

### Types of Steam
- **Saturated Steam:** Occurs where gas (steam) and liquid (water) coexist.
- **Wet Steam:** Contains non-vaporized water molecules.
- **Superheated Steam:** Created by further heating saturated steam beyond its saturation point; higher temperature and lower density than saturated steam at the same pressure.

## 3. Classification of Boilers
Boilers are classified based on:
1. **Contents of the tube:** Fire tube (gas inside) vs. Water tube (water inside).
2. **Firing system:** Internal fired vs. External fired.
3. **Position of drum:** Horizontal, Inclined, or Vertical.
4. **Pressure:** 
   - Low-pressure (< 80 bar)
   - High-pressure (> 80 bar)
   - Supercritical (≥ 221 bar)
5. **Water Circulation:** Natural (density difference) vs. Forced (pumps).

## 4. Requirements of a Good Boiler
- Low installation/operation/maintenance costs.
- High efficiency and safety.
- High transportability and steam production rate.
- Quick steam generation and ability to meet fluctuating demand.

## 5. Specific Boiler Models
| Boiler | Type | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cochran** | Fire tube, Vertical | Internal fired, multi-tube, natural circulation. |
| **Babcock & Wilcox** | Water tube, Horizontal | External fired, natural circulation, 11.5-17.5 bar. |
| **Locomotive** | Fire tube, Horizontal | Internal fired, movable, artificial draught (short chimney). |
| **Lancashire** | Fire tube, Horizontal | Internal fired, dual furnace tubes, used in sugar mills. |
| **Cornish** | Fire tube | Similar to Lancashire but with only **one** tube. |

## 6. Performance Parameters
- **Actual Evaporation ($m_a$):** kg of steam generated per kg of fuel.
- **Factor of Evaporation ($F_e$):** $F_e = \frac{h - h_f}{2257}$
- **Equivalent Evaporation ($m_e$):** $m_e = m_a \times F_e = \frac{m_a(h - h_f)}{2257}$
- **Boiler Efficiency ($\eta$):** $\eta = \frac{m_a(h - h_f)}{C}$ (where $C$ is calorific value).

## 7. Mountings & Accessories
> [!abstract] Key Difference
> - **Mountings:** Essential for **safety** and control (e.g., Safety valve, Pressure gauge).
> - **Accessories:** Used to increase **efficiency** (e.g., Economizer, Superheater).

### Common Mountings
- **Safety Valve:** Releases excess pressure (Nozzle, Disc, Spring).
- **Water Level Indicator:** Shows water level; includes safety balls for tube breakage.
- **Pressure Gauge:** Uses Bourdon tube/quadrant mechanism.
- **Fusible Plug:** Extinguishes fire if water level drops too low.
- **Blow-off Cock:** Removes sediments or empties the boiler.

### Common Accessories
- **Economizer:** Heats feed water using waste flue gases.
- **Air Preheater:** Heats combustion air; increases efficiency by 2-10%.
- **Superheater:** Converts wet steam to superheated steam.
- **Steam Separator:** Removes water particles from steam.
